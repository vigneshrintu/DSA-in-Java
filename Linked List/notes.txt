->In linked list nth last node or nth node from the end is the (size-n+1)th node
form the beginning
->Cycle removal algorithm doesnot work for circular linked list where the fast and slow meets 
at head node and that linked list length is equal  to the cycle length.
->If there is only one object and you want to call static method of that class
on that object then just do myMethod() in main and it will be triggered.
->we use head of the linked list as top of the stack if we have to implement the stack using linked list
->If we use a data structure like an array and we continously starts to remove or add elements into it 
inside a loop whose length is the size of the data structure (array here) then its size is not constant since
we are adding or removing elements into it.So loop length wont be constant and changes continously.
